                This thing is a Thneed. A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need! It's a shirt. 
                It's a sock. It's a glove. It's a hat. But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that. 
                You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!
                Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats!
