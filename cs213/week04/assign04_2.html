                Our conflict with Haters!

                You won't get success without reason to frown.<br>
                I saw something pop out of the stump of the tree I'd chopped down. <br>
                It was sort of a man. Describe him...That's hard. I don't know if I can. <br>
                He was shortish, and oldish, and brownish and mossy. <br>
                And he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy.<br>
                Then I told him off quick and I sent him away!<br>
                And I'm certain that won't come to bite me some day.

                Pictured, The Lorax, he speaks for the trees. I asked him politely to shut up, if he'd please.
