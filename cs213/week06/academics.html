                    Every young witch or wizard will navigate the path among Magical classes as they:
                    Wander through a non-OSHA-inspected ancient buildng full of cursed architecture that 
                    has no intention of getting you where you want to go!<br>
                    Fall down trick stairs and have rugs pulled out from under you and all of that mischief!<br>
                    Discover un-monitored secret passageways, with, as rumor has it, a Basilisk chamber somewhere!
