                <p class="">Dear Prospective Student or guardian,
                    We are pleased to inform you that you or someone for whom you are responsible have been
                    accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                    Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
                    Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl or, by very recent update, your
                    "electronic" confirmation by no later than 31 July.

                <h3>Heritage</h3>
                <p>
                    When a young Witch or Wizard student enters the illustrious halls of Hogwarts, and school that has
                    stood for well over a
                    hundred years, they will be immersed in the shared Cultural Heritage of people like them: those who
                    are
                    gifted with Magic. This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to mingle with peers of a similar
                    age,
                    magical potential, and even temperament, to some degree, as they are sorted into their Houses.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="blocks">
                <h3>Magic and Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    There will, regrettably, be no modern "computers" or "WiFi",
                    as these are merely a device that is used to connect students and their families to
                    school resources, and, as a matter of fact do not work while on Hogwarts grounds.
                </p>
                <p>Magic and technology have an inherent disconnect, and we cannot recommend that any student bring valuable items that run on "electricity" or other complex non-magic onto the grounds.</p>
