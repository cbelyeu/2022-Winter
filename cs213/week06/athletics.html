            <h2>Quidditch</h2>
            <p>
                Quidditch is played by flying children and enchanted metal balls that soar through the air hitting
                people.
                Did their mothers approve?
                We don't know!
                We are so good at responsible adult things.
                Concussions are quite frequent! Luckily, we use magic to make all of the injuries go away. That
                reassures parents, right?

                But don't worry! All exercise will be done sitting down, and the only people who actually get any
                exercise will be the ones on the four House teams, and whoever shows up for tryouts.

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                The majority of the students will sit in bleachers enjoying the monumental thrill of screaming at
                the referee.
                Or not. Whatever they prefer.

            <h3>TriWizard Tournament</h3>
            <p>
                We have rumors of an even more exciting Tri-Wizard Tournament to come!
                An undisclosed number of competitions will be held either underwater or in the depths of an
                impenetrable maze.
                We are so good at exciting competitions that we will sit out there for hours if need be.
                There'll be snacks!

            <p>
                Frankly, we're just going to send that Potter boy out of line of sight and read a book for a change.
                He won't get into too much trouble, will he?

                Spectator sports are so much more relaxing when you can't see what the children are getting into.
