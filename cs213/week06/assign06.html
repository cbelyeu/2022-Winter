            <p class="">Dear Prospective Student or guardian,
                We are pleased to inform you that you or someone for whom you are responsible have been
                accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
                Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl or, by very recent update, your
                "electronic" confirmation by no later than 31 July.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a young Witch or Wizard student enters the illustrious halls of Hogwarts, and school that has stood for well over a
                hundred years, they will be immersed in the shared Cultural Heritage of people like them: those who are
                gifted with Magic. This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to mingle with peers of a similar age,
                magical potential, and even temperament, to some degree, as they are sorted into their Houses.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will, of course, be no modern "computers" or "WiFi", 
                as these are merely a device that is used to connect students and their families to 
                school resources, and, as a matter of fact do not work while on Hogwarts grounds.
            </p>
            <p>
